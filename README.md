The "Wearable Sign Language Interpreter: Real-Time Gesture Recognition and Audio 
Synthesis System Using Flex Sensors and Accelerometer" project introduces an 
innovative solution designed to facilitate communication for individuals with hearing 
impairments. Leveraging advancements in sensor technology, signal processing 
algorithms, and wearable computing, this system aims to bridge the gap between sign 
language users and non-signers in real-time communication scenarios. By integrating 
flex sensors and an accelerometer into a wearable device, the system accurately 
captures and interprets sign language gestures, converting them into audible speech 
output. This real-time translation capability not only enhances accessibility for the 
hearing impaired but also promotes inclusivity by enabling seamless interaction with 
individuals who may not be proficient in sign language. The project's implementation 
involves a comprehensive design approach encompassing hardware development, 
sensor calibration, gesture recognition algorithms, audio synthesis techniques, and user 
interface design. Through rigorous testing and evaluation, the system demonstrates its 
efficacy in accurately recognizing a wide range of sign language gestures and 
producing intelligible speech output. The potential impact of this technology extends 
to various domains, including education, healthcare, and everyday communication, 
where improved accessibility and communication tools can significantly enhance 
quality of life for individuals with hearing impairments.
